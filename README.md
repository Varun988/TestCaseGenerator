# Streamlit-Based Test Case Generator Using Azure OpenAI with OOP
This Streamlit application generates test cases for a given code snippet using the Azure OpenAI model. The app is designed with an object-oriented approach to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability. It accepts two user inputs:

The programming language of the code.
The code for which test cases are to be generated.
The application validates the programming language by analyzing the provided code using OpenAI's model. If the detected language matches the user-provided input, it proceeds to generate detailed and concise test cases for the code.

# Uses
Generate Test Cases: Automatically generate test cases for code snippets in various programming languages. This can save significant time during development and testing.

Programming Language Validation: Validate if the code snippet matches the programming language specified by the user. Ensures accuracy before generating test cases.

Streamlined Workflow: The intuitive Streamlit interface makes it easy for developers to input code and get instant results in their browsers.

Educational Use: Useful for students and beginners to understand how test cases are written for different programming constructs.

Code Quality Assurance: Helps QA engineers and developers ensure their code behaves as expected by quickly generating relevant test cases.

Language Detection: Aids in detecting and confirming the programming language of unknown code snippets.

Scalable and Modular Design: The OOP approach ensures that this app can be extended with additional features such as saving results, supporting more programming languages, or integrating with other tools.
